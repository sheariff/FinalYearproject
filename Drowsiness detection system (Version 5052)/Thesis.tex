 This projects objective is being able to track a persons eyes or facial expressions for cues that would lead to the detection of drowsiness. The Drowsiness detection system will use eye tracking technology that is open sourced and computer vision libraries and tool kits such as openCV to develop a functioning Drowsy detection system,  Machine learning algorithms will also be used to successfully identify when a person is starting to fall asleep or the persons eyes are starting to close, Perclos is an algorithm used to detect if a persons is drowsy using the persons eyelid shape, once the system has detected that the persons eyes have been closed it then emit a warning single to the driver by way of a loud sound that will wake the driver up prevent him from falling asleep.
